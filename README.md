A young robotic hero is re-activated by Py, from a race of snake-like beings called Pytrons, who have the power to manifest themselves in the world’s computers. The hero becomes Py’s new vessel as he explains that his race is being held captive by an entity known as The Terrible Thon, who has an iron grip over the world’s technology. With Py’s help, the hero must utilize the power of programming to save the Pytrons and the world as they know it.
